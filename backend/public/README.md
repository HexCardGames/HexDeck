# Static Frontend Hosting

All files in this directory will be merged into the server binary and served as static assets by the HexDeck server.

When building with docker, the compiled frontend will be copied here automatically.

If you are building manually, you can copy the contents of the `dist/client/` folder here after building the frontend.
